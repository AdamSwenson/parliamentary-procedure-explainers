Title: Parliamentary procedure

We are the brain of a giant robot. 

Unfortunately, it's one of those old-timey, steampunk, mechanical brains. Just gears, ropes, pulleys, and a giant spinning flywheel. Right now, the robot is idle; the flywheel spins but it's not engaged.

To move this poorly engineered monstrosity, two of us must pull a rope which turns the platform everything is mounted upon until the wheel spins toward the desired direction.[^fn1] Still the robot does not move. The gears are not engaged. Once more than half of us pull on another rope, the gears engage and our leviathan moves.[^fn2] 


The senate is a composite entity; senators comprise it. The senate is an agent; it can act. Though it only ever does one thing, it resolves. It declares what its will is, usually through resolutions. 

To get the senate moving toward an action, someone makes a motion. Once someone else agrees it is worth considering (they second the motion), the senate decides whether to act. If more than half of the senators think it is worth doing, the senate acts.


If you'd like to know why the robot is designed this way, read on.  

If not, hmmm, let's see.... Maybe this is ---I'm just spitballing here--- maybe it's an amusing image you can invoke when trying to keep your cool during tense meetings? No? Hmmm.....

[^fn1]: Any 2 of us can pull the rope. We all have equal strength (or, if you like, the complicated pulley systems means we all exert the same force, regardless of how hard we pull).

[^fn2]: Ok, fine. I know Leviathan was a sea serpent. But, look, the cover of Hobbes' Leviathan famously shows a king composed of the people. And, this is basically Hobbes' picture of how the brain/mind works. Also, Hobbes hated deliberate assemblies so there's even a soup√ßon of irony. So, c'mon, let me have 'leviathan'. Please?
